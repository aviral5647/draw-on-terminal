# Terminal Whiteboard (draw.py)

A small terminal-based drawing tool written in Python using the curses library, where you can draw using your keyboard alone.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (tested on Linux and Windows) 
- A terminal supporting curses (ncurses). On most Linux systems Python's builtin curses works out of the box.

## Run

Open a terminal with at least 80Ã—24 characters and run:

```bash
python3 draw.py
```

### Terminal Compatibility
If you experience issues with input not working (spacebar not drawing, etc.), try:

```bash
# With debug mode to see what's happening
WHITEBOARD_DEBUG=true python3 draw.py

# Or with specific terminal type
TERM=xterm-256color python3 draw.py
```

**Note**: The program has been enhanced for better terminal compatibility. See `TERMINAL_FIX.md` for detailed troubleshooting if you encounter issues in different terminal environments.
